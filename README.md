# STILL_juce

Prototype of generative music app with JUCE. (https://juce.com/)

See https://jandenbesten.bandcamp.com/album/still for the original music.
Idea is to create an app to generate the music of STILL with user input for length.

I moved development of this app to iOS only with Swift and AudioKit (https://audiokit.io/).
See also my Swift library for a Markov Chain (https://github.com/JanBurp/simpleMarkovChain).
